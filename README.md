# Flashcard-o-matic

## Summary

Flashcard-o-matic is a web app that allows users to create, edit, and study decks of flashcards using React function components. This project created as my frontend capstone project for Thinkful's Software Engineering program. I designed a sleek and stripped-down user interface using vanilla CSS, and I organized routes and nested routes using React Router.
